# Android v1 Embedding Error - Solution

## ðŸš¨ Problem
The error "Build failed due to use of deleted Android v1 embedding" occurs because the Flutter project is using the old Android v1 embedding, which has been deprecated and removed.

## âœ… Solution

### Method 1: Recreate Flutter Project (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to the Flutter app directory:**
   ```bash
   cd quran-flutter-app
   ```

2. **Recreate the Flutter project:**
   ```bash
   flutter create . --project-name quran_app
   ```

3. **This will regenerate all Android files with the correct v2 embedding.**

### Method 2: Manual Fix (If Method 1 doesn't work)

The Android configuration has been updated with the correct v2 embedding. The key changes made:

1. **AndroidManifest.xml** - Updated with `flutterEmbedding` value `2`
2. **MainActivity.kt** - Created with proper Flutter v2 embedding
3. **build.gradle files** - Updated with correct configuration
4. **Project structure** - Properly organized

### Method 3: Clean and Rebuild

1. **Clean the project:**
   ```bash
   cd quran-flutter-app
   flutter clean
   ```

2. **Get dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Key Files Updated

- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Flutter embedding v2
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/quran_app/MainActivity.kt` - New MainActivity
- `android/app/build.gradle` - Updated configuration
- `android/build.gradle` - Updated build script
- `android/gradle.properties` - AndroidX enabled

## ðŸ“± Testing

After applying the fix:

1. **Run in debug mode:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Build for release:**
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

The app should now build and run successfully without the Android v1 embedding error.

## ðŸ“ž If Issues Persist

1. **Check Flutter version:**
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

2. **Update Flutter:**
   ```bash
   flutter upgrade
   ```

3. **Check Android SDK:**
   - Ensure Android SDK is properly installed
   - Check that `ANDROID_HOME` is set correctly

The project is now configured with the correct Android v2 embedding and should work properly! ðŸš€
