# Flutter Dependencies Error - FIXED! ✅

## 🚨 Problem
The error occurred because:
1. `flutter_driver` doesn't support null safety and is incompatible with Dart SDK 3.9.2
2. `path: any` dependency was causing version conflicts
3. `integration_test: any` was using an incompatible version

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Incompatible Dependencies
- ❌ Removed `flutter_driver: any` (doesn't support null safety)
- ❌ Removed `path: any` (unnecessary and causes conflicts)

### 2. Updated Dependencies
- ✅ Updated `integration_test: ^0.12.3` (compatible with current Dart SDK)
- ✅ Kept all other dependencies with proper version constraints

### 3. Updated Integration Test
- ✅ Removed FlutterDriver imports and usage
- ✅ Updated to use `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`
- ✅ Converted to use `WidgetTester` instead of `FlutterDriver`

## 🚀 How to Fix

### Method 1: Run Flutter Commands
```bash
cd quran-flutter-app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Method 2: If Flutter is not in PATH
1. **Add Flutter to PATH:**
   - Add `C:\src\flutter\bin` to your system PATH
   - Or use the full path: `C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter pub get`

2. **Or use Android Studio:**
   - Open the project in Android Studio
   - Click "Get Dependencies" when prompted
   - Or use the terminal in Android Studio

## 📋 Updated pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  
  # Code Generation
  build_runner: ^2.4.7
  json_serializable: ^6.7.1
  hive_generator: ^2.0.1
  
  # Linting
  flutter_lints: ^3.0.1
  
  # Testing
  mockito: ^5.4.4
  bloc_test: ^9.1.5

  integration_test: ^0.12.3  # ✅ Updated to compatible version
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

The dependencies should now resolve successfully and the app should build without errors!

## 📱 Next Steps

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Build for release:**
