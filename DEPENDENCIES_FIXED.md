# Flutter Dependencies Error - FIXED! ✅

## 🚨 Problem
The error occurred because `integration_test` is not a regular package that can be added to `pubspec.yaml`. It's a built-in Flutter testing framework that comes with the Flutter SDK.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Removed integration_test from pubspec.yaml
- ❌ Removed `integration_test: ^0.12.3` from dev_dependencies
- ✅ `integration_test` is a built-in Flutter package, not a pub.dev package

### 2. Updated Dependencies
The final `pubspec.yaml` now has clean dependencies:
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  
  # Code Generation
  build_runner: ^2.4.7
  json_serializable: ^6.7.1
  hive_generator: ^2.0.1
  
  # Linting
  flutter_lints: ^3.0.1
  
  # Testing
  mockito: ^5.4.4
  bloc_test: ^9.1.5
```

### 3. Integration Test Setup
- ✅ Integration tests are in `integration_test/` folder
- ✅ Uses built-in `integration_test` package (no pubspec dependency needed)
- ✅ Properly configured with `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### Method 1: Use the Batch File (Easiest)
```bash
# Double-click run_app.bat in the quran-flutter-app folder
# Or run from command prompt:
cd quran-flutter-app

```

### Method 2: Manual Commands
```bash
cd quran-flutter-app
C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter clean
C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter pub get
C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter run
```

### Method 3: In Android Studio
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Click "Get Dependencies" when prompted
