Create a Mushaf-style Arabic Quran reading screen in Flutter that faithfully represents the Arabic Mushaf pages using my JSON files (alquran_cloud_complete_quran.json for verses, pages, and surah info). The app should display pages, verses, and surahs exactly as in the Mushaf with proper Arabic layout, verse numbers, and symbols.

Requirements:

Data Handling:

Use alquran_cloud_complete_quran.json as the single source of truth.

Each verse has fields like: surahId, verseNumber, arabicText, page.

Pages must be grouped exactly according to the page field. Do not reset page numbers per surah.

Surahs can start on any page, possibly continuing from the previous surah.

Verse Layout:

Verses must flow inline, not each starting on a new line.

End-of-verse symbols must appear exactly as in the Mushaf.

Verse numbers should be in Arabic numerals (١, ٢, ٣…) and appear at the end of the verse, not at the beginning.

Only show Bismillah at the start of a new surah (except Al-Fatihah where it appears normally).

Page Layout & Scrolling:

Display pages horizontally (right-to-left), like a real Mushaf.

Users should see the current page number from JSON and total pages.

Each page should contain all verses belonging to that page, respecting line breaks and spacing as in the real Mushaf.

Ensure that verses do not get cut off or overflow beyond the visible screen area; implement proper scrolling or scaling if needed.

Typography & Styling:

Use a proper Arabic font (Amiri, Uthmanic, or similar).

Maintain Mushaf-style spacing, alignment, and line height.

Optionally, provide responsive font scaling for different screen sizes.

Minimize extra UI clutter (page controls, headers) so the focus is on the verses themselves.

Performance & UX:

Implement lazy loading of pages to optimize memory usage.

Allow smooth horizontal swipe navigation between pages.

Optional features: bookmarks, progress tracking, night mode.

Implementation Constraints:

Do not manually hardcode verses or pages; all content must come from JSON.

Maintain continuous flow of surahs across pages; follow JSON page assignments strictly.

All logic should be modular and maintainable.

Deliverables:

Flutter widget(s) that display the Mushaf screen exactly like a real Quran.

Code that reads the JSON and generates pages, verses, and layout dynamically.

Example of rendering 1–2 pages correctly using the JSON.
