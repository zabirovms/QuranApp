Goal:
Create a unified screen that allows users to switch between Mushaf mode (Arabic Mushaf pages) and Translation mode (translations, tafsir, transliteration, etc.) seamlessly.

Requirements:

Understand Existing Screens

Review the current Mushaf screen: how pages are grouped by the JSON "page" field, RTL horizontal scrolling, verse numbering, and continuous page flow (1â€“604).

Review the current Surah screen: translation, tafsir, transliteration, and existing UI.

Unified Screen Layout

The unified screen should have a toggle button or tab switch to select between Mushaf mode and Translation mode.

Default view: Mushaf mode (Arabic Mushaf pages). When users click a surah from surah list in main screen, they should be directed to the page where that surah starts. Users can switch to Translation mode for details.

When switching modes, the user should stay on the same page/verse corresponding to the JSON page field.

Paging & Scrolling Logic

Both modes must use the same page logic (grouped by JSON "page" field).

Mushaf mode: horizontal RTL scrolling, continuous flow of surahs across pages.

Translation mode: vertical scrolling within a page, horizontal swipe to go to next page (based on JSON "page" field), continuous surahs.

Multiple surahs may appear on the same page in both modes if dictated by JSON page field.

Navigation from Home Screen

When a user clicks a surah from the home screen, the unified screen should open the page where that surah starts.

The toggle between Mushaf and Translation mode should preserve the current page.

Modular Implementation

Paging logic should be reusable between both modes.

The code should be modular to allow future enhancements (e.g., audio sync, bookmarks, night mode).

Freedom for Creativity

You are free to use your best judgment and creative approach to meet the above requirements while maintaining performance, readability, and UX quality.

Deliverable:

Unified, toggle-able Mushaf & Surah screen.

Proper paging, navigation, and UI alignment.

Consistent behavior with existing JSON page structure.

Fully functional in the current app layout and theme.
